# Implemented Artificial Neural Networks
## Back propagation
This is the first multi-layer network developed. It allows to train **hidden layers** between the input layer and the output layer.
   * **BP_XOR**: Solves the XOR problem using backpropagation using sigmoid activation function (values from 0 to 1)
   * **PERCEPTRON_AND**: Solves the AND operator using a simple multi-layer perceptron. Back propagation fails solving this simple problem
