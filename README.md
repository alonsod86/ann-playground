# Implemented Artificial Neural Networks
## Back propagation
This is the first multi-layer network developed. It allows to train **hidden layers** between the input layer and the output layer.
   * BP_XOR: Solves the XOR problem using backpropagation using sigmoid activation function (values from 0 to 1)
